# Testing strategy

Each folder in this directory aims to test parts of the master eslint config.
Tests are not exhaustive by any means, and dont intend to test every single rule defined in the master config (main.js), but rather tests that rules from specific plugins are actively working when passed through the eslint linting cli.
